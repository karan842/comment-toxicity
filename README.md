<h1 align="center">COMMENT TOXICITY DETECTION‚ö†Ô∏èüí≠‚ùå</h1>

# About Projectüìú
This is an end-to-end data science project, it is focuses on detecting toxicity in the comment/text using Deep Learning based API.

## The Planü§î

1. **Business Goal/Problem Statement:** Sometimes internet becomes the worst place, some people are spreading hate and vulgar comments on user-engaged platforms suxh as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Amazon, etc. To stop this shameful acts we have to restrict the comment section on internet platforms for this we need some AI algorithm which can detect toxicity. The main goal of us (as ML engineers) is to create an *Machine Learning System Design*.

2. **Data**: I collected this data from **Kaggle Competition** which [Toxic Comment Classification Challange](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge). The data is in the form of *text* but stored in a `.csv`. It has multiple labels for each comment in the data. Those categories are `toxic, severe-toxic
